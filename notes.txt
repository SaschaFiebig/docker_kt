build docker image with our code in it 
    docker build -t <container_name> <path_to_container>
check images 
    docker images 
start docker container 
    docker run -d -p 80:80 <image_id>  # -d=daemon, -p=port, image_id can be gathered from the 'docker images' command
check running containers 
    docker ps 
    docker ps -a  # to see when existing containers have been stopped 
open local website running from the container by typing 'localhost' in our browser url field

stop container 
    docker stop <names | container_id>  # names & id can be found by using the 'docker ps -a' command
to restart an existing container 
    docker start <names | container_id>
delete container
    docker rm <names | container_id> 
delete image 
    docker rmi <repository | image_id>  # can be found by using 'docker images' 

open shell into our container 
    docker exec -it <image | names> /bin/bash  # if bash does not work, use sh
